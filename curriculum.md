Outline
=======

Note: Shorthand ruby is a source of confusion, use long hand and introduce
the shorthand versions of the syntax further into the material.

---

* Data types: Strings, Integers, Floats
* Variables
* Constants
* Arithmetic
* Printing: puts, print, p
* String Interpolation

---

* Special characters: \n
* Getting user input

---

* Converting between data types (`int` and `string`)
* Pry (ls, ?, $)

---

* Calling methods on an object
* Integer methods, Float methods, String methods
* built in functions (like rand, puts and many more)

* Methods vs functions
* Functions
* Shorthand syntax sneak peak: function parentheses
* Default values for functions

* Test Driven Development (principles only)
* Test assertions sneak peak: Used in the function exercise

---

* Data types: Booleans
* Predicate methods
* Comparison operators

* Control flow (`if`, `elsif`, `case`, etc.)

---

* Arrays

* Loops (finite, infinite and break)
* Enumerable (each, map, filter, etc.)
* Blocks (do...end, {})

---

* Hashes
* Data types: Symbols

---

* Parsing JSON and CSV

* Shorthand hash syntax: 1.8 vs 1.9
* Shorthand syntax: function parentheses, implicit return, hash curly braces

---

* Classes


Bonus Material
--------------

These should be moved to a suitable place based on exercises:

* Incrementing a counter
* Generating a random number

---

* Exceptions

* Test Driven Development recap
* Test assertions: Using them
