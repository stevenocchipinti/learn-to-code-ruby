Outline
=======

Note: Shorthand ruby is a source of confusion, use long hand and introduce
the shorthand versions of the syntax further into the material.

---

* Data types: Strings, Integers, Floats
* Variables
* Constants
* Arithmetic
* Printing: puts, print, p
* String Interpolation

---

* Special characters: \n
* Getting user input

---

* Pry (ls, ?, $)
* Converting between data types (`int` and `string`)
* Calling methods on an object
* Integer methods, Float methods, String methods
* built in functions (like rand, puts and many more)

* Methods vs functions
* Functions
* Shorthand syntax sneak peak: function parentheses
* Default values for functions

* Test Driven Development (principles only)
* Test assertions sneak peak: Used in the function exercise

---

* Data types: Booleans
* Predicate methods
* Comparison operators
* Boolean logic: and, or, not

* Control flow (`if`, `elsif`, `case`, etc.)

---

* Loops (times, finite, infinite and break)
* Blocks (do...end, {})

* Incrementing a counter

* Arrays
* Enumerable (each, map, filter, etc.)

---

* Hashes
* Data types: Symbols

* Parsing JSON and CSV

---

* Classes
* Exceptions

Bonus Material
--------------

* Shorthand hash syntax: 1.8 vs 1.9
* Shorthand syntax:
  * function parentheses, implicit return, hash curly braces, postfix if, unless
  * Ternary statements

* Options hash idiom, named parameters

* Test Driven Development recap
* Test assertions: Using them
