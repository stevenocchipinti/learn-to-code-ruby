# Study Guide

As part of this course you have been using a Udemy course called _"Learn To Code
With Ruby"_. (This guide is relevant to version 4)

https://www.udemy.com/learn-to-code-with-ruby-lang/learn/v4/content

This course is very detailed and provides quite a comprehensive guide to the
Ruby programming language. Please feel free to go through the course in its
entirety, as intended by the author.

However, as the audience of our little study group are not full time students
and not everyone can devote full time hours to study to this, I am going to
attempt to outline what I think would be the **minimum required set of videos**
for each chapter in order to participate in the exercises we'll go through in
our sessions.

I've tried to select videos for each exercise in three categories:

* _Minimum_ - The smallest amount required to do the exercise
* _Better_ - Once you've watched the minimum videos, watch these if you can
* _Bonus_ - These ones are good to know but not the most important

## Exercise 0: Setting up a development environment

**Minimum:** All steps relevant for your operating system
**Better:**
**Bonus:**

**Note:** Windows users can use
[this guide](https://community.rea-group.com/people/steve.occhipinti/blog/2017/11/22/installing-a-ruby-dev-environment-on-windows)
instead.

## Exercise 1: Getting started

**Minimum:** 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24
**Better:**
**Bonus:** 19

## Exercise 2: Number guessing game

**Minimum:** 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 30, 31, 32, 33
**Better:** 28, 34, 35
**Bonus:** 36, 37, 38

* Variables
* Getting user input (from the terminal)
* Control flow (`if`, `elsif`, `case`, etc.)
* Comparison operators (`==`, `<=`, `>=`, etc.)
* Loops (finite and infinite)
* Incrementing a counter
* Generating a random number
* Converting between data types (`int` and `string`)
