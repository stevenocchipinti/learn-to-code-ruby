# Learn To Code Ruby

This repo contains some exercises to learn how to code in Ruby.

There are some separate exercise projects in this repository. Each one should
give you an opportunity to practice some new skills, below is a list of learning
outcomes for each project.

## Exercises

Each exercise has it's own folder and an `app.rb` file that contains some
comments explaining how to complete the exercise.

## Solutions

Solutions are available on a separate branch called "solutions" if needed.

## How to run it

Clone/download this repo, `cd` to the exercise directory in a terminal and type:

```
ruby app.rb
```
